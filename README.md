# 📦 Installation & Setup
## 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

     git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator.git  
     cd calculator  

## 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Tkinter is usually pre-installed with Python. If you get a ModuleNotFoundError, install it:

For Ubuntu/Debian
 
     sudo apt update  
     sudo apt install python3-tk -y 

For Fedora
   
     sudo dnf install python3-tkinter  

For Arch Linux

     sudo pacman -S tk  

# ▶️ Run the Calculator
     python3 frontend/calculator_gui.py  

This will launch the GUI calculator where you can perform arithmetic operations.

# 🔧 Usage
* Click numbers and operators to form expressions.
* Press = to calculate the result.
* Press C to clear the input field.

# 🛠 Future Improvements
Add support for advanced mathematical functions (square root, power, percentage).
Implement a dark mode theme for better UI.
Convert to a web-based calculator using Flask/Django.
